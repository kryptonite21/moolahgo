    <p>What is Moolahgo?</p>
    <p>MoolahGo is a Financial Technology (Fintech) company licensed and regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to offer online money changing and online remittance businesses in Singapore. In fact, we are the first online money changer in Singapore operating based on a regular full license. We believe that we are also the largest online money changer currently in Singapore. Since May 2018, we have also been approved to become a Stored Value Facility (SVF or e-Money) Holder as we prepare to launch our e-Wallet product in early 2019.</p>
