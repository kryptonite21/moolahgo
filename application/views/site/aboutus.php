    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
MoolahGo is a regulated Financial Technology (Fintech) company that provides digital financial services to individuals and businesses. Our slogan "Your Money. Your Way." perfectly reflects our mission. This mission is to make financial services fair and accessible for everyone and at their own terms. The story started when its Founder realized that the current way of performing basic transactions have not really changed much even though new fintechs have sprouted up in recent years â€“ Consumers still do not have the power to transact on their terms!
</p>

<p>
And not to mention that countless of people are today still going through the traditional time-consuming and unappealing ways of performing financial transactions. And worst of all, unnecessarily paying high costs for them.

With the Founding team assembled and after copious amounts of testing and development, MoolahGo made its debut in January 2018 with two products (i.e. Currency-exchange and Cross-border payments).

Other exciting financial products will be offered in the near future.
